Lessons Learned: 
A major lesson learned from this project was how to effectively work in groups on programming assignments. Prior to this project, none of our group members had worked in groups larger than two people, which meant there was some headaches for us when trying to coordinate with more than just one other person. The biggest issue was our forth member not contributing to the assignment or showing up to class to communicate with us, but we managed the situation by continuing the project with the three of us.
